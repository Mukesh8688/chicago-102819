Keeping your personal fork updated with the class' github repo us very important, as the Instruction team updates it almost every day.

Each time you want to update, you have to be in your local master branch `git checkout master`:

`git fetch upstream`
`git rebase upstream/master`

## Update your personal fork's changes

While in your local master branch, type in the terminal

`git push origin master`
